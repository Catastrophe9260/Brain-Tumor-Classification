# Brain Tumor Classification
Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow to differentiate between certain types of brain tumors. The model classifies 2D brain MRI scans as having a specific type of tumor or no tumor.

## Types of Brain Tumors
1. Glioma - growth of a tumor from glial cells which normally support neurons.
2. Meningioma - growth of a tumor from the meninges which are membranes around the brain.
3. Pituitary - growth of a tumor in the pituitary gland which are usually benign.

## Dataset Info
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and consists of 512 x 512 brain MRI scans with 3 channels. I've also uploaded it to this repo as its a rather small one (~151 MB)!

Below is how I structured my project folder - especially what the dataset directory looks like and how its broken down into the training + testing set.
